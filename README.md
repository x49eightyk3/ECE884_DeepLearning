# ECE884 Deep Learning for Denoising of Audio Files
# Introduction:
This project focuses on the automatic function of denoising audio signals using machine learning, and feeding clean audio output to a speech to text recognition model to calculate word error rate, compared to noisy audio.
This project features the CNN created by Daitan Innovations (Link here), with the evaluation metrics performed using Meta's Wav2Vec.
